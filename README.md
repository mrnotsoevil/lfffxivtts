# Local Fast FFXIV Text-To-Speech

![Screenshot](https://github.com/mrnotsoevil/lfffxivtts/blob/0fac4bfa9774aaf80e05a38b8c289868312ca3c1/dev/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This is a *local* voice server for the [TextToTalk](https://github.com/karashiiro/TextToTalk) Dalamud plugin, meaning
that it will use your computer's resources for TTS generation.

Uses the [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) project to rapidly generate TTS output based on existing models.
**This software does not do voice cloning of existing FFXIV characters.** Instead, voices were provided by the
TTS software were matched as close as possible to some characters.

Supports [noisereduce](https://pypi.org/project/noisereduce/) and [voicefixer](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer)
to improve the generated TTS output. (voicefixer is turned off by default due to the computational cost and
multiprocessing issues).

**Runs fully on CPU, meaning that you do not need a high-end GPU.**

**Current support**

* ‚úÖ English (vctk_en_gb voices)
* ‚úÖ German (mls_de voices)
* ‚úÖ French (mls_fr voices)
* ‚ùå Japanese (couldn't find any models)

A list of voice samples can be found [here](https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/).

üëâ If you find better models that piper can work with (high quality audio), feel free to inform me via a GitHub issue.

## Usage

Download the package and extract it.

* Windows: Double-click the `start.bat` file
* Linux/macos: No package ready yet, sorry (use the dev environment and run the main.py)

In the TextToTalk plugin, choose the **Websocket** backend and
set the port to 8081 (default for this tool).

The TTS tool should automatically connect to the Dalamud plugin within a few seconds.

Please give the TTS a few seconds to generate the audio. You can turn off noisereduce if you want
a bit more performance (not much).

## Setup (Development)

This will require Python 3.10, various dependencies, and a special piper version with support for
custom phonemes.

* Python 3.10
* `pip install sounddevice websockets aioconsole voicefixer pydub wxwidgets noisereduce pyloudnorm`
* `mkdir tmp && cd tmp && git clone https://github.com/mrnotsoevil/piper.git`
* `pip install tmp/piper/src/python_run/`

### Running

* To run the GUI, start `lfffixvtts/main.py` from the **repo root directory** (where config.json is)
* To test out the TTS (debugging), you can `tts.py` to get a CLI. There you can type in `<npc name or id>//<text>` for
  an NPC voice or `any//<text>` for random voices. Change the language with `lang <de/en/jp/fr>`.

### Adding voice models

This operation is done usually fully automatically.

1. Add voice models in the format `<model name>_<en/jp/fr/de>.onnx` and `<model name>_<en/jp/fr/de>.json`
   into `piper/models`
2. Use piper to generate sample audio and put it
   into `dev/voices/tts/<en/jp/fr/de>/<model name>_<en/jp/fr/de>_<speaker id>_<male/female>.wav`
3. Provide reference audio of FFXIV characters in  `dev/voices/tts/references/<en/jp/fr/de>/<name>.wav`. The name should
   be lowercase and have only letters from a-z (e.g., G'raha will be graha)
4. Run the `dev/generate_voicedb.ipynb` notebook. It will compare the TTS voices with the characters and generate a
   mapping for the NPCs.
